Key Responsibilities:

Preprocessed a large dataset from Kaggle to handle missing values and normalize features like ratings and popularity.
Engineered features by encoding multi-value genres and scaling numeric attributes for better model performance.
Built and fine-tuned a KNN-based recommendation model for personalized anime suggestions.
Evaluated the recommendation quality using metrics such as precision and recall.
Optimized the system for scalability and integrated it with Python scripts for user queries.
Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Kaggle Dataset, Machine Learning, Data Preprocessing.

Outcome: Successfully recommended highly relevant anime to users based on their preferences, with high accuracy and scalability.
